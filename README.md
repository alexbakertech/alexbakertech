# Hi, I'm Alex Baker — Homelab Architect & Infrastructure Automation Enthusiast

Privacy-focused IT Specialist building secure, reliable homelab systems with Linux, cloud-native tools, and cybersecurity. Hands-on in network segmentation, detection, backups, and automation.

**Current Focus**  
Actively building an open-source **Personal Security Platform** — practical tools solving real homelab challenges: secure remote access → real-world detection → centralized operations.

1. **nat-bridge** (Active Development) — Drop-in system to expose services behind hostile NATs/CGNAT using WireGuard reverse tunnels + minimal cloud jumpbox. Builds on reliable backups for remote resilience.  
2. **decoy-siem** (Next Up) — Self-contained honeypot + Suricata/Wazuh stack to capture and analyze live attacks. Draws from my earlier DLP testbed for inspection and monitoring.  
3. **alert-router** (Planned) — Lightweight webhook router for alerts from backups, honeypots, and monitoring → Discord/email/Slack with severity routing.

**Featured Projects**  
- **[Incremental Backup Orchestrator](https://github.com/alexbakertech/incremental-backup-orchestrator)** (Latest: Jan 2026) — Lightweight shell script for atomic rsync increments, tiered hardlink snapshots, flock concurrency, and webhook notifications. Zero heavy dependencies, designed for stateful services.
